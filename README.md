# Melee-StaminaHP

This project is a modification for "Super Smash Bros. Melee", a Nintendo GameCube game.
It targets the GameCube which has a PowerPC CPU.

The goal is to allow players to set Stamina HP via user input. By default it's always set to a constant 150.

The GCC toolchain used for this project can be found here.
